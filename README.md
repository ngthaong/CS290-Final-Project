3. The online game of Tic-Tac-Toe was the concept of our group. The premise behind the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game is straightforward but captivating, and it can be made more original and dynamic with imaginative concepts. 

Gamers have the option to play against one another. The game can be made more interesting by using visual components like themed boards (such as those with nature, space, or cultural icons) for successful moves and a black and white theme for the entire website. 

We're also thinking of adding a timed challenge mode where players compete against time to finish the game or a score system that keeps track of wins, losses, and ties.
